## Overview 
This repository contains code and supplementary data for the publication "Computational Analysis Reveals Temperature-Induced Stabilization of FAST-PETase".

## Software Requirements
The code has been tested on the following systems:
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

**Python Dependencies** <br />
THIS WILL BE ADAPTED
We recommend using `miniconda3` to set up a Python 3.10 virtual environment. This software has been tested with:
```
python=3.10.8
numpy=1.26.4
rdkit=2024.03.3
transformers=4.33.3
ankh=1.10.0
biopython=1.83
pytorch=2.0.1
pytorch-cuda=11.7
pyg=2.5.2
```
THIS WILL BE ADAPTED
Alternatively, create a Conda environment from scratch with the following commands:
```
conda create --name GEMS python=3.10

## Methods and Code Availability
We provide relevant data and code snippets utilized for:
a) CNAnalysis
b) RMSD/RMSF analysis
c) Secondary structure analysis
d) Hydrogen bonding analysis
e) Energy of unfolding calculation
