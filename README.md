## Overview 
This repository contains code and supplementary data for the publication "Computational Analysis Reveals Temperature-Induced Stabilization of FAST-PETase".

## Software Requirements
The code has been tested on the following systems:
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- 
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

**Python Dependencies** <br />
THIS WILL BE ADAPTED
We recommend using `miniconda3` to set up a virtual Python environment. This software has been tested with:
```
python=
numpy=
pandas=
mdtraj=
openmm=

WHAT ELSE IS IMPORTANT? Especially plots!

```
THIS WILL BE ADAPTED
Alternatively, create the Conda environment from YAML file with the following commands:
```
conda env create -f sim.yml
conda activate sim
```
## Methods and Code Availability
We provide relevant data and code snippets utilized for:

a) CNAnalysis (https://cpclab.uni-duesseldorf.de/cna/)

b) MD simulations & analysis (https://openmm.org/documentation ; https://mdtraj.org/1.9.4/analysis.html)

-RMSD/RMSF analysis 

-Secondary structure analysis

-Hydrogen bonding analysis


c) Energy of unfolding calculation 

Please note, that the energy calculations rely on external standalone software of EvoEF1, EvoEF2 and FoldX:
